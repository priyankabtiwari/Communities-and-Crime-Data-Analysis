# Communities-and-Crime-Data-Analysis

## Background
In sociology, the social disorganization theory is a theory developed by the Chicago School, beginning with the social disorganization approach of Shaw and McKay (1969). They argued that socioeconomic status (SES), racial and ethnic heterogeneity, and residential stability account for variations in social disorganization and hence informal social control, which in turn account for the distribution of community crime. This theory directly links crime rates to neighborhood ecological characteristics; a core principle of social disorganization theory states that location matters. In other words, a person's residential location is a substantial factor shaping the likelihood that the person will become involved in illegal activities. The theory suggests that, among determinants of a person's later illegal activity, residential location is as significant as or more significant than the person's individual characteristics (e.g., age, gender, or race).

Sampson and W. Byron Groves (1989) extended the model of social disorganization by Shaw and McKay (1969). They performed empirical study on five dimensions related to community structure, which impacts social disorganization (refer Fig 1.)

## Problem Statement
- Can the crime rate of a community be explained by certain attributes/variables of the community? - The attributes cover several demographic aspects including resident age, household income, poverty level, education level, employment condition, homeless rate, divorce rate, parent marital status, property ownership status, immigration status, etc. Goals of Analysis
- To identify the socio-economic variables contributing to the five dimensions in the extended model of Shaw and MaKay’s theory from the dataset from University of California
- To empirically test the explanatory power of extended model of Shaw and MaKay’s theory in explaining the crime level in the community.
